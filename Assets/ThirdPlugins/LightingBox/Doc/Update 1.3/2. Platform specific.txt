Don't forget:(for next-gen platforms - DX11 or GL4+)   

1. Your rendering path must be Deferred (edit->project->graphics)

2. Color space should be Linear (player settings)

3. Graphic API should be DX11(Windows) or OpenGL4(Mac) for HDR and DX9 for non HDR (Player Settings)

4. DX11/GL4 is supported only for volumetric Lighting (Player Settings )

5. Allow HDR should be on in camera components (Inspector)

6. Allow MSAA should be disabled in the Camera components (Inspector)

7. Shadows should be activated in quality settings (edit->project-> quality)

Specially when you have imported a new complete project(for example UFPS) you must re setup these 7 steps again for your project



For WebGL and DX9 :

1. Install Unity 2017.2 for WebGL2.0 and Linear color space support (Lighting Box is based on Linear color space by default)

2. Disable Eye-Adaptation from post processing stack profile

3. Go to Edit->Project->Player settings and remove WebGL1.0 platform (first unchecked Auto Graphics API)

4. Got to Edit->Project->Player settings and set 512 or 1024 as WebGL Memory Size in Publishing Settings (Test on web browser about memory limitations)

5. Disable Volumetric Light from Lighting Box Window



DX 9  support :

1. Disable Eye-Adaptation from post processing stack profile

2. Disable Volumetric Light from Lighting Box Window
