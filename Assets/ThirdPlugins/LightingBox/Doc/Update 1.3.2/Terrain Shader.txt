Terrain shader

- You can find terrain shader from LightingBox/Terrain 6-Layers

- LightingBox terrain shader has been used Tessellation technique. So it needs DirectX 11-12 on Windows and OpenGL Core (OpenGL 4.0+) on mac or linux

- Performance is maximum (You can reduce max tessellation to get higher performance. Current (4.3) is the best choice
also tessellation amount will depend on our terrain height map and height map resolution. Flatten areas has less tessellation amount   


Terrain shader has :

- Displacement map (stored in alpha channel of the albedo texture )

- Smoothness map (will be automatically read from blue channel of the albedo texture )

- Normal map (separate texture sample)

- Albedo (separate texture sample). Must be saved in TGA or PSD file format to get displacement map from its alpha channel (watch the videos)


How to use
1. Create a new terrain. select layers (brush icon) and create 4 sample splats-layers (or simply drag terrain prefab from LightingBox prefabs folder into your scene)

2. Add LightingBox Terrain  component into your terrain

3. Create a new material in you project files

4. Assign created material into Material slot of the LightingBox Terrain component

5. Press Initialize to start working on tessellated terrain
